# FitCast – Outfit Weather Assistant

FitCast is a Streamlit web application designed to help users decide what to wear
based on weather conditions, personal comfort levels, and style preferences.

Rather than overwhelming users with raw forecast data, FitCast applies
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles to translate weather information
into clear, actionable outfit suggestions.

## Features
- Weather-based outfit recommendations
- Comfort-level adjustments (e.g. “I am a furnace”)
- Style-based clothing logic
- Optional shoe suggestions
- HCI-focused design and decision support

can be found in `Project_2_Report.pdf`.
